# Step 6: Diagnosing an issue based on telemetry data
* Within the transactions you're examining, what segment(s) took the most time?
  > Enter Response Here.
* Using New Relic, identify and record the least performant request(s).
  > Enter Response Here.
* Using the Transaction Trace capability in New Relic, identify which segment(s) in that request permeation is/are the most problematic and record your findings.
  > Enter Response Here.
* Recommend a solution for improving the performance of those most problematic request(s) / permeation(s).
